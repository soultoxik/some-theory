Okay, let's give some basic introduction.
_Topology space_ just a pair of some set **S** and set of subsets **O**, following three rules:
1. empty set and **S** itself included in **O**
2. for any finite count of elements from **O** intersection in **O** too
3. same in case of union

In this case:
* **O** called _topologic structure_ or simply _topology_
* any element from **X** called _dot_
* any element from topology called _open set_
