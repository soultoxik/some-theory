This collection of chapters will describe some basics aspects about several
fields of discrete math and computer science, including topology, homology
theory, theory of categories. Primary intent was learn and describe with
simple language latest. All information was taken from ...
Category theory - field of math, describing abstract structures with similar
characteristics; slightly difficult to find simple and well-look examples for
demonstration, so we well use less abstract and more concrete fields such as
topology. So plan looks like this:
1) learn some valuable minimum from topology
2) same for homology theory
Expected that reader knows some basics of set theory.
